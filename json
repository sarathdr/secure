Hi Karol,

Hope you are doing well!

We need some assistance from you for Snowflake integration in the production environment. I have pushed a draft, based on the assumption that the AWS account remains the same for both UAT and production, will the roles also remain consistent with those in UAT? 

Can we clone the private key secrets of the database user? If so, we might need your help with cloning those secrets.

Is there anything else we should consider before applying these changes to production?

It would be great if you could review the code whenever you have some free time.
